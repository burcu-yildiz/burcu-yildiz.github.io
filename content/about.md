I am a second-year M.Sc. student in Computer Science at EPFL, where I am also a research scholar at [Laboratory for Computation Security (COMPSEC)](https://compsec.epfl.ch) led by Assoc. Prof. Alessandro Chiesa. I am broadly interested in Theoretical Computer Science, especially Complexity Theory and Cryptography. I have a particular interest in probabilistic proofs, which I focus on as a research scholar. I have also done my semester project on [parallel repetition of PCPs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1714).  

Before joining EPFL, I studied Mathematics with a double major in Computer Engineering at Koç University, where I was an intern at Cryptography, Security, and Privacy Research Group headed by Assoc. Prof. Alptekin Küpçü. As a receipent of Alan Howard Research Fellowship, I worked on a biometric authentication project under the supervision of Prof. Serge Vaudenay at Security and Cryptography Laboratory (LASEC) during my first year of studies at EPFL. 

Besides my studies, I participate in Women+ in IC association at EPFL. In my free time, I like watching movies and listening to music. I used to do marbling (called "ebru" in Turkish, which is usually described as painting on water), which I cannot continue right now due to lack of atelier but you can [check some of my work](../marblings) that were exhibited at the student exhibition of Marbling club at Koç University before.
